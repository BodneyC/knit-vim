# Knit Vim

This is a language support plugin for a knitting pattern language I've been using for a while.

For the most part, this was just to make the knitting pattern a little more readable as I was developing the compiler for it, indent support was also a practical addition for the same purpose.

For more information about the language, please see [knit-and-go](https://github.com/BodneyC/knit-and-go).

__Note__: I am aware the above link does nothing at the minute... still working on it...
